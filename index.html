<u><font color="#FFFF99">Motivation/Background</font></u></h3>
<p>
Accurate stellar parameters are important, the goal is to create a collection 
of stars with accurate stellar parameters. To do this, we will utilise detatched
eclipsing binary stars as benchmark stars.
</p>
<p>
  (Talk briefly about why benchmark stars are important and why binaries are 
  particularly useful)
</p>

<a href="https://platomission.com/" target="_blank">PLATO</a> (PLAnetary
Transits and Oscillations of stars) is the third medium-class mission
in ESA's Cosmic Vision programme. PLATO was adopted by ESA Science Programme
Committee in June 2017 and is due to be launched in 2026. Its objective is to
find and study a large number of extrasolar planetary systems, with emphasis
on the properties of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around
solar-like stars. PLATO has also been designed to investigate seismic activity
in stars, enabling the precise characterisation of the planet host star,
including its age.
</p>

<p>
  (Add something on the quality of constraints needed for the mission.)

<h4> <u><font color="#FFFF99">Citizen scientist contributions</font></u></h4>
<p>
  List benefits with using citizen science observations, e.g. scheduling and 
  apperture field of view (for reference stars)
</p>

<p>
  Highlight some previous examples (from the already studied benchmark catalog)
</p>

<p>
  (We need to put the specifications of how accurate the data needs to be somwhere,
  rough telescope size, seeing etc would be useful)

Here, the current collection of <a href="BenchmarkDEBS/index.html">spectra for
benchmark eclipsing binary stars</a>, i.e. stars for which we have precise
and accurate mass, radius and effective temperature measurements. The goal is to
continue expanding this list with the help of high quality photometric and 
spectroscopic observations.

<h3> <u><font color="#FFFF99">Instrumentation</font></u></h3>

<p>
  In preparation for the PLATO mission, we are gathering and analysing eclipsing 
  binary data using a range of scientific instruments mounted on telescopes from 
  around the world.
