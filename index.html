        A compilation of eclipsing binary benchmark stars for the PLATO mission.
      </center>
        <p>
          Using a combination of both space and ground based observations, this page compiles
          a list of well-studied eclipsing binaries with accurate fundamental parameters as
          well as high quality and high resolution spectra that can be used for further 
          characterisation of their composition and structure.

      <h3><u><font color="#FFFF99">Motivation/Background</font></u></h3>
      <p>
        The motiation for this project is that, as high quality data of millions stars 
        have been collected, is to provide a database of high quality stellar spectra 
        obtained from detached eclising binary stars where their stellar parameters have
        been determined with high accuracy.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Binaries are particularly interesting for this purpose. The reason for this is 
        that their stellar parameters can be determined independently from conventional
        stellar models. Thanks to their orbital motion and eclipses, the masses and 
        radii of the stellar components can be determined with high accuracy. Thanks 
        to the recent developments in distance measurments by the GAIA project, it is
        also possible to obtain high precision effective temperatures for each components.

      <p>
        <a href="https://platomission.com/" target="_blank">PLATO</a> (PLAnetary
        Transits and Oscillations of stars) is the third medium-class mission
        in ESA's Cosmic Vision programme. PLATO was adopted by ESA Science Programme
        Committee in June 2017 and is due to be launched in 2026. Its objective is to
        find and study a large number of extrasolar planetary systems, with emphasis
        on the properties of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around
        solar-like stars. PLATO has also been designed to investigate seismic activity
        in stars, enabling the precise characterisation of the planet host star,
        including its age.

        (Add something on the quality of constraints needed for the mission.)

      <h4> <u><font color="#FFFF99">Citizen scientist contributions</font></u></h4>
      <p>
        While much of this work relies on large astronomical telescopes, significant
        progress can be made using observations from citizen scientists. The reason 
        for this is that we focus on bright targets that can readily be observed even 
        with smaller telescopes. In addition, the relatively long (~5 days and longer) 
        orbital periods makes scheduling on large facilities challenging.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some work partialy dependent on citizen scientist observations have already 
        been successfully carried out. One such example is <a href="BenchmarkDEBS/index.html#CPD-54_810">CPD-54 810</a> (Please verify that this is correct) 
        that used photometric observations from the 0.3 m Perth Exoplanet Survey Telescope (PEST).
      </p>

      <p>
        (We need to put the specifications of how accurate the data needs to be somwhere,
        rough telescope size, seeing etc would be useful)
